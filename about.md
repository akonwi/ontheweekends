      My name is Akonwi Ngoh but some people know me as Akon. I like creating things on computers and traveling. On The Weekends is all about travel, fashion, and enjoying life. Here you'll find posts about places I've been, things I've seen and done, or stuff I enjoy as an early 20's consultant living life on the road. Weekdays are tough, so enjoy your weekends! You can also keep up with my adventures on instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/on_the_weekends/">@on_the_weekends</a>.
