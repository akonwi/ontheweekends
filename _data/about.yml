    My name is Akonwi Ngoh but some people know me as Akon. I like creating things on computers and traveling. On The Weekends is all about travel, fashion, and enjoying life. Here you'll find posts about places I've been, things I've seen and done, or stuff I enjoy as an early 20's consultant living life on the road. Weekdays are tough, so enjoy your weekends! You can also keep up with my adventures on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/on_the_weekends/">@on_the_weekends</a>.

    My name is Matt Schappell, but for the sake of the 2000s song, you can call me Young Jeezy- Akon and Young Jeezy. Remember? Anyways, I am a huge fan of a few things: fashion, travel, and people. On The Weekends is an avenue where one can see all three of these things combined. For those of us who don't get the luxury of traveling every weekend, this account provides rejuvenation, excitement, and ideas to our every day life. If interested in providing content, partnerships, or ideas for our blog or Instagram account, feel free to drop me a line in the DM on the Instagram account. Enjoy!
