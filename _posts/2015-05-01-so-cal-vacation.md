This past week, I was in beautiful southern California for a much needed vacation. I've been burned out at work and in the last 8 months I haven't had much time to myself so this was a week of solid me-time.

On Sunday, I flew into LAX and I had a reservation for a car through Silvercar. Silvercar is a car rental company with a fleet that consists of only one type of car, a silver Audi A4, which comes equipped with wifi, GPS, and XM radio. If it wasn't for my Platinum status with SPG, I probably would never have come across Silvercar or try to rent with them. Thankfully, this year's choices of a gift for Platinum members with 50 nights included a Silvercar for up to 5 days free. This is a great option if you're going to be in one of the cities that they operate in and you don't want to be uber-dependent. Anyway, I had a great experience with Silvercar. When I landed, they texted me and offered to pick me up and when I returned the car, they drove me to the airport. There is a shuttle that goes to the car rental area but if that can be avoided then why not do it?

So immediately after I got my car, I drove to Dana Point in Orange County to spend a night at the St. Regis Monarch Bay. The St. Regis brand is the most luxurious of all the Starwood brands I think so it can be pretty pricey. I only stayed one night and I booked the cheapest rate available because I just wanted to check St. Regis of my list for the year (I've stayed at 8/11 Starwood brands this year). Luckily, I was upgraded to a very nice suite (only half-pictured below) that made me wish I was staying longer. Unfortunately, this property is undergoing a lot of renovations to the pool and outdoor areas so those weren't accessible. After June 1st, it'll no longer be part of the Starwood chain so it's cool that I had a chance to enjoy it before the split.

On Monday afternoon, I drove to Santa Monica and checked into the Le Meridien Delfina. I've stayed there once before and I liked it enough to come back. This place is great because of the proximity to the beach and Santa Monica Pier. It's about a 20 minute walk to the pier and beach and shopping at the 3rd Street Promenade. The valet service is complimentary so having a car is not a hassle. My reservation here was for 5 nights and I booked it on points. At 9,600 starpoints a night, 48,000 total is a great deal for almost a week at a category 5 hotel. I didn't receive a suite upgrade but I was placed in an Ocean View room. Though the view isn't spectacular, it beats the view of the apartment complex next door that I had previously and it has an "extended" balcony, which is 3x the size of the regular balconies. The view is the background photo of this post if you aren't reading this from a phone.

My favorite thing about this hotel though is one dish served at the restaurant. It's called "Mary's Free-range Chicken" and it is the best meal I've had at any Starwood hotel and possibly any hotel in general. The chicken is roasted and stuffed with spinach, served with whipped potatoes and vegetables on the side. It sounds pretty basic but it's mighty tasty.  

As far as how I spent my time during the week, I simply drove around, worked out, did some shopping, started reading a new book, watched movies, and hung out on the beach a bit. Essentially, I pretended to be unemployed and it was great. Unfortunately, it was a bit too chilly (65ยบ F) for me to fully enjoy the beach. I also visited the Getty Villa, which is part of the J Paul Getty museum that showcases Roman antiquity. The villa is located off of the Pacific Coast Highway and is free but costs $15 dollars to park. Apparently, reservations should be made online (though it's free?) and you should print your tickets before you go because the lady at the entrance made a big fuss about me not having my ticket when I got there and then she gave me one from the pile she had. Now you know...

All in all, it was a great week for relaxation in southern California and I'd easily do it again.
