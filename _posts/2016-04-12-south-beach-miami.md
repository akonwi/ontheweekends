My colleague and friend, Eugene and I had been discussing taking a weekend trip together for a while. I initially wanted to go to LA but that fell through. So we decided on Miami because...well it's Miami! It was a beautiful weekend in April and I'm not sure the weather could have been any more perfect. It was high 70's - mid 80's.

## The Hotel
We stayed at the Four Points By Sheraton and the hotel was much better than I expected at 10,000 Starpoints a night. The hotel is a limited service brand amongst the Starwood Hotels and they sent me an email prior to my arrival explaining I may not get the treatment and amenities I would be used to as a Platinum member, so I had lower expectations. When I arrived, I was upgraded to a suite, with a wonderful view (pictured below) and a complimentary bottle of red wine that evening. The wine was probably cheap but it's the thought that counts.

## Food
We didn't have bathing suits and flip flops because hey, we travel with a bag full of work clothes. We went to the Lincoln Road Mall to shop and ended up eating there because it was 1pm and all I had consumed all day was champagne. We ate at a restaurant called Y.U.C.A. which stands for "Young Urban Cuban American." Though we only ate a bunch of appetizers, the food was delicious, especially the Bacon Wrapped Dates. Try them if you're ever there! For dinner, we ate at Texas de Brazil. I'll skip the details because everyone knows Brazilian steakhouses. We went to two different brunch places that weekend. The first was American Social. It was highly recommended by locals and they had bottomless mimosas so we had to go. The food was good but not great and was a typical brunch. The other brunch spot was Nikki Beach (pictured below). This place is a utopia. [Nikki Beach](http://www.nikkibeach.com/) is luxury beach club chain. There are a few around the world and this one in Miami is the sole American location. I recommend making a reservation if you plan on going. The food was amazing but the twist here is it's a buffet with everything served fresh from seafood to paella made right there. No bottomless mimosas but at $7 a pop, I'm not complaining. My favorite thing about Nikki Beach is that there were bubble machines blowing bubbles everywhere. They just made the vibes great. We ate dinner Saturday night at a place called Meathouse also on Lincoln Road. It was meh...

## Nightlife
I can't stay out late but I was told that's how they live in Miami. We enjoyed the nightlife in the Wynwood area. It's the new neighborhood for millennials in Miami and it was pretty lively. My favorite spot we went to is called Coyo Taco. Don't be fooled by its humble appearance as a mere taco joint. Walk to the back and there is a small club with a rotation of talented DJs. On your way out at 4am, make sure to get some quesadillas they may be trying to throw away because those things are hands down the best quesadillas I may ever put in my mouth. I didnt' go to sleep until 5 or 6am both nights but it was a great time.

## Conclusion
Miami was great overall. When I go back next, I'll shell out the extra stack of Starpoints to stay at the W or Royal Palms because those are nicer and better positioned than the Four Points. Though Wynwood was cool, it may be worth checking out the nightlife in South Beach next time.
